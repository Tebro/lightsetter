# Lightsetter

When all else fails, reinvent the wheel


## Build

```
make
```

## Install

```
sudo make install
```

This installs as /usr/bin/lightsetter

Owner is set to root and the setuid bit is on.

## Usage

```
lightsetter 100
lightsetter -100
```

or something like that, bind whatever keys you want to these kind of commands in your i3 config or something
